# Xcode Project Cleaner

XCode automatically generates xcuserdata folders in .xcodeproj folder and in .xcworkspace folders...,this shell script removes excess xcuserdata folders from your project, that may cause XCode to crash upon run or file selection.

WARNING : please backup before using, this was mostly needed in XCode 7, new XCode don't show bad behaviours like this.
